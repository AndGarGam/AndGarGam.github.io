	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<div class="About Me"><p> Hello, my name is Andres Garcia Gamino. I am a senior at Canoga Park High School
		and I am finishing my second year at the Northrup Grumman Program, HIP, High School Involvement Program. I
		would like to pursue a career in engineering, although I am not yet sure quite what kind, I have been 
		leaning towards biomedical. I want a career in engineering because I enjoy thinking outside the box to solve
		difficult problems or to find a better solution to a problem that has already been solved. Since I was a child,
		I had always displayed an interest in mathematics and science, but I never knew if I leaned more towards math
		or science. I took many difficult math classes and science classes to see if my interest would persist, and 
		fortunately, it has. I strive to fullfill both of these desires by choosing a career that has both aspects,
		which is where biomedical engineering comes in. I decided to apply to the HIP Program to see if I could
		nuture these interests or see if I liked engineering in general, and so far, the journey has been great.
