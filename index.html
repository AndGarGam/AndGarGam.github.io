	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<div class="about"><p> Hello, my name is Andres Garcia Gamino. I am a senior at Canoga Park High School
		and I am finishing my second year at the Northrup Grumman Program, HIP, High School Involvement Program. I
		would like to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. I want a career in  mechanical engineering because I 
		enjoy thinking outside the box to solve difficult problems or to find a better solution to a problem that has 
		already been solved. Since I was a child, I had always displayed an interest in mathematics and science, but I
		never knew if I wanted to pursue a career relating to these areas. I took many difficult math classes and 
		science classes to see if my interests would persist, and fortunately, they have. I strive to fullfill both
		of these desires by choosing a career that has both aspects, which is where engineering comes in. I decided to apply 
		to the HIP Program to see how I could nuture these interests or to see if I liked engineering in general, and so far,
		the journey has been great.
