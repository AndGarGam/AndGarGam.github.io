	<h3>What I learned about Python</h3>
		<div class="About Me"><p> Python is a programming language used for programming. Compared to other
    languages such as C, Python is relatively simpler such that it is more beginner friendly. Learning about Python when I was making my first
    GUI, I learned that there were many wrappings and add-ons that supported Python such as Anaconda and Cython which are meant to integrate
    C++ or C# with Python. Despite this, programming is far from easy, as there are many setbacks that require
    patience, determination, and focus to overcome those obstacles. Although I did not utilize python for my project,
    it was still fun trying to assemble a GUI and have widgets that could be utilized for your project, 
    as well as trying to fix the errors that ocurred and the search and satisfaction that came from fixing those errors.
